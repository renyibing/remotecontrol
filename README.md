# WebRTC Native Client Momo Remote Control

This project is based on the original repository https://github.com/shiguredo,
modified by [Bob Haskins] for additional features and optimizations.

Project Update & Acknowledgment

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the momo team for their outstanding open-source contribution.
This project is based on the original momo source code and has been further developed and extended to support remote control and interaction features.

üîß Overview of Modifications

The SDL side is defined as the receiver.

The sender side captures the screen, encodes, and transmits audio and video data to the receiver in real time.

The receiver uses SDL‚Äôs input control system to interact with and control the remote sender‚Äôs computer.

Supported input devices include:

Keyboard

Mouse (including mouse image display)

Game controller

Touch input

üåê Communication Modes

P2P Mode

Enables direct peer-to-peer communication within a local network (LAN).

Provides low-latency streaming and control without a relay server.

Relay Mode (via Ayame Signaling Server)

By deploying an Ayame signaling server, users can enable relay communication over the public internet.

Utilizes WebRTC‚Äôs STUN/NAT traversal for seamless connectivity across different network environments.

Allows users to remotely control their own computers securely over the internet.

## About H.264 License Fees

Distributing Momo by itself, which uses only the H.264 hardware encoder, does not require a license fee.
However, distributing it with hardware requires a license fee.

However, for Raspberry Pi, the H.264 license is included in the hardware cost, so no license fee is required.

For details, we recommend contacting [Via LA Licensing](https://www.via-la.com/).

We have contacted Via LA Licensing (formerly MPEG-LA) and confirmed that Momo's H.264 support is not subject to royalties.

> If Shiguredo provides a product that relies on an AVC/H.264 encoder/decoder already present on the end user's PC/device,
> the software product will not be subject to the AVC license and will not be eligible for royalties.

- The license fee for the Raspberry Pi hardware encoder is included in the price of the Raspberry Pi.
- <https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=200855>
- Apple's license fee is limited to personal and non-commercial use; distribution requires a separate agreement with an organization.

## About H.265 License Fees

Distributing Momo using only the H.265 hardware encoder does not require a license fee.
However, distributing it with hardware requires a license fee.

We have contacted the following two organizations regarding Momo's H.265 support and have confirmed that distributing binaries that use only the H.265 hardware accelerator does not require a license.

We have also confirmed that releasing Momo, which supports H.265 and utilizes only the H.265 hardware accelerator, as open source and distributing pre-built binaries does not require a license.
