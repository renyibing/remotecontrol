## About H.264 License Fees

Distributing Momo by itself, which uses only the H.264 hardware encoder, does not require a license fee.
However, distributing it with hardware requires a license fee.

However, for Raspberry Pi, the H.264 license is included in the hardware cost, so no license fee is required.

For details, we recommend contacting [Via LA Licensing](https://www.via-la.com/).

We have contacted Via LA Licensing (formerly MPEG-LA) and confirmed that Momo's H.264 support is not subject to royalties.

> If Shiguredo provides a product that relies on an AVC/H.264 encoder/decoder already present on the end user's PC/device,
> the software product will not be subject to the AVC license and will not be eligible for royalties.

- The license fee for the Raspberry Pi hardware encoder is included in the price of the Raspberry Pi.
- <https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=200855>
- Apple's license fee is limited to personal and non-commercial use; distribution requires a separate agreement with an organization.

- The license fee for the AMD video card hardware encoder requires a separate agreement with an organization.

## About H.265 License Fees

Distributing Momo using only the H.265 hardware encoder does not require a license fee.
However, distributing it with hardware requires a license fee.

We have contacted the following two organizations regarding Momo's H.265 support and have confirmed that distributing binaries that use only the H.265 hardware accelerator does not require a license.

We have also confirmed that releasing Momo, which supports H.265 and utilizes only the H.265 hardware accelerator, as open source and distributing pre-built binaries does not require a license.
